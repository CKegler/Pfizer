**The challenge**:  Given an input string of English characters,
 find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
 
**The solution**:  In linear time, this approach uses a sliding window technique
  to identify non-repeating character substrings.  When we encounter a repeating,
  character, we jump to a point after repeated character
